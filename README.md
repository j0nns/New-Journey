<h1>soul surfing</h1> 

<p>If I could type one word that best describes me it would be calm. I have a great enthusiasim about learning how to see the underlying ways of how the web works. I'm intrigued by all of the generosity the world has to offer. I hope to one day give back what I've learned. </p>
